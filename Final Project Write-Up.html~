<h1>Machine Learning: Final Project</h1>
<h2>Cleaning the Data and Building the Model</h2>
<p>I began by exploring the data, specifically looking for large segments of NA values.
I chose to remove columns that had over 19200 NA values, and then applied near-zero variance,
which led me to remove the 'new_window' variable.  I also examined the variable names and removed
several variables that did not seem like they would have significant impact on the outcome, 
such as 'user_name', several time stamp variables, and the 'X' variable, which appeared to be an
observation number.</p>
</br>
<p>I used the caret package to build an initial random forest model used 53 features to predict the classe.  I
applied the variable importance function and found that there was a drop off in importance after the top nine features (see Figure 1).  I then built a second random forest model using the top 9 features, which is the version I used for submission due to time considerations.  After applying variable importance to the second model, I found that I could likely remove the 'accel_dumbbell_y' variable and possibly the 'roll_forearm' as they received very
low overall scores.</p>
